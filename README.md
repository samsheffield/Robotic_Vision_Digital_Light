# About this repository
This repository contains samples of code created for student use in the course, Robotic Vision/Digital Light, which took place in 2013 at the Maryland Institute College of Art. 

Some of the samples in this repository are based on examples from Daniel Shiffman's Learning Processing, and Greg Borenstein's Making Things See. I've tried to credit them accordingly when their code was used as a basis for an example.
